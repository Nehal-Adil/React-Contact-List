# Contacts List

It is a React App to manage your Contacts. In this Web App you can add your contacts, edit and delete your contacts too.



## Features

- Single Page App
- Add Contacts
- Edit Contacts
- Delete Contacts

We are fetching user data from this dummy API 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'

Add a contact, make a POST call to the given url (from where you are fetching) and save the contact in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add contacts to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data).

Update a contact, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).

Delete a contact, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
